Components are only half the architecture though. The other half are the people and their practices that make the components. They are at least as important, but are almost never taken into consideration. This is like the design of a car, without the factory to actually make it. Their practices should be centered around change and maintenance as systems do not run themselves. Systems require continual adaptation and maintenance after their conception to stay relevant. Like the car, it needs a garage and maintenance schedule. Or maybe there is no garage in IT and it is the factory that needs to reproduce a fitting means of transportation each day. Be it a sedan, a station wagon or an SUV.

Plan sessions of 60 to 90 minutes in your agenda for doing deep work. Plan this weekly and refine daily at set times. Plan both subject and goal for each session in advance. Follow the optimal process given de subject during each session. At the start of the session close all communication and distractions. Open only your reference material and your output. Put on your headphone and start supporting music. Set your phone to quiet and put it face down on the table. Close Teams, Chats and Emails. Close Planners and Agendas. Close Windows that don't contribute to the subject. Close Notes. Open a new notepad if needed. At the end of the session open all communication channels and answer all simple and urgent requests.

It secures connections, but how seems a mystery. This leaves us with statements like \"your credit card data will be stolen when you use self-signed certificates\". Nobody knows, but it sounds scary enough so it must be true. Or is it? TLS has two main functions. The first is encrypting data in transit. The second is providing trust on a public network. Encryption is the important one, but it is trust that we get worked up about. Encryption TLS encrypts TCP packets between client and server, using a key that only they know. This ensures that only the client and server can read the data they exchange. No intermediate can eavesdrop. The details are more complex, but this is the essence. Data is secured between the two parties. That is it. Fail-fast This encryption is guaranteed, because TLS is a fail-fast protocol. If the communication cannot be encrypted, it will not happen. This contrary to the browser messages saying your connection might not be safe. These messages only apply to trust and never to encryption. Trust TLS can also provide trust about the server that the client connects to. The server provides a certificate that holds the server address and is signed by a third party. The client can choose to trust the third party and its signed confirmation of the server address. Trust on the public network Trust is relevant on an untrusted network where client data can be intercepted by an intermediate system that poses as the intended server. The client can then be tricked into leaking sensitive information like password or credit card data. The trust function verifies that the server is the intended address. In an uncontrolled network it is useful to assure that data is sent to the intended recipient. In a controlled network though, this is useless at best. Here is why. Commercial CA's Trust, or more accurately \"TLS host verification\", works by first trusting the certificate of the Certificate Authority (CA) that signed the server certificate. This will let the client trust all the server certificates that the CA signs. Browsers and operating systems are preconfigured to trust a list of commercial CA's and server certificates are bought from these CA's. So because Chrome trusts a bundle of CA's and the site you are browsing has a certificate that is signed by one of those CA's, you don't have to worry about TLS. How different that is on a private network. Rolling your own Trusting a preconfigured commercial CA is no different from trusting a CA that you create yourself. It provides the same level of trust. The difference is that a certificate from your own CA is free, which makes it preferable over commercial CA's. The downside of this is that you have to configure each client to trust your CA. This configuration comes at a cost as well. That is when you should evaluate trust itself. Is there a change that a client can connect to an unverified server? If so, make the investment of configuring each client with your CA. If not, then you are better off with turning host verification off in your TLS connections. It delegates trust to your known network and leaves you with encryption. No more, no less. But my browser says When you decide that servers are known and that host verfication has no added value in your particular context, there is still your browser that screams bloody murder. That is because TLS host verfication was designed for the internet with non-technical users in mind. Just click OK and know that your connection is encrypted and safe.","title":"Trusting TLS"},{"location":"tech/trust_tls/#trusting-tls","text":"TLS is one of the most used and least understood technologies.
