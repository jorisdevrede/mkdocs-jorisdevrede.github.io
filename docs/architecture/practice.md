# Components are only half the architecture

When we think of systems architecture we usually picture a diagram with
components and their relations, sometimes complemented with principles
on how to structure them. Thise components are only half the architecture
though.

The other half consists of the people and their practices that make the
components. They are equally important, but are almost never taken into
account. This is like designing a car without considering the factory
to actually make it. 

Practices should be centered around change and maintenance as systems
do not run themselves. Systems require continual adaptation and
maintenance to stay relevant. Like the car that needs a garage and
maintenance schedule.

Or maybe there is no garage in IT and it is the factory that needs
to reproduce a fitting means of transportation each day. Be it a
sedan, a station wagon or an SUV. All the more reason to pay
attention to the architecture of the factory; to the architecture of 
our practices.
