# Components are only half the architecture

When we think of systems architecture we usually see a diagram with
components and their relations, sometimes complemented with principles
on how to structure them. Components are only half the architecture
though.

The other half are the people and their practices that make the
components. They are at least as important, but are almost never
taken into consideration. This is like the design of a car, without
the factory to actually make it.

These practices should be centered around change and maintenance as
systems do not run themselves. They require continual adaptation and
maintenance after their initial conception to stay relevant. Like
the car, it needs a garage and maintenance schedule.

Or maybe there is no garage in IT and it is the factory that needs
to reproduce a fitting means of transportation each day. Be it a
sedan, a station wagon or an SUV. All the more reason to pay
attention the the architecture of the factory and that factory is 
us and our practices.
