# Absorption Speed

> *Reading time: ~1 minute.*

[Research estimates](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332380784_How_many_words_do_we_read_per_minute_A_review_and_meta-analysis_of_reading_rate)
that we read around 240 words per minute (wpm) and can comfortably
[listen](https://clearly-speaking.com/what-is-the-ideal-rate-of-speech/) to
speech at 140 wpm. We absorb information faster while reading than listening.

These numbers only apply when we concentrate though. As Nicolas Carr points out
in his book
[The Shallows](https://www.amazon.com/Shallows-What-Internet-Doing-Brains/dp/0393339750),
we find it increasingly difficult to focus. In an age of swiping to the next
sound bite, we tend to compromise on the absorption speed of written text and
settle for videos or podcasts that can keep our attention. While video has its
use when learning a physical activity, it is often the slower option when
taking in information.

The same goes for meetings. A meeting can have its use. It can be effective
for bonding socially, or for discussing emotionally loaded subjects. It is
inferior to text though when exchanging facts. Then 'that meeting really should
have been an e-mail'.

So opt for reading over listening when you need to take in information, and
write your knowledge down so others can make that choice too. All it takes is a
little focus.
