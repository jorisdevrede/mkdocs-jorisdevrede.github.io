# Taking Notes

Most people limit note taking to the obligatory meeting minutes. Notes can be
much more useful though. Here is why.

## Unstructured Brains

Our brains are not built for structured infomation. They can hold over a
[petabyte](https://www.salk.edu/news-release/memory-capacity-of-brain-is-10-times-more-than-previously-thought/){target=_blank},
of data, but retrieve a memory with the same context that its stored with. This
can be anything. This is like trying to use Google, not knowing which *exact*
combination of words, pictures, or even music you need to input to get the right
results.

The brain has a bias for recently handled memories. What is on top of mind feels
more important, even if it is not. This can leave you with an inferior idea,
because you thought of it more recently.

Ideas are fluid, especially complex or detailed ones. Our brains are great at
adapting ideas to a new context, but this can unknowingly change our standpoints
ever so slightly with every meeting that we have. The adaptive quality of our
brains are good for problem solving, but bad for taking a stand and staying on
course.

## Structured Notes

Notes can be more than the action items of a meeting. They can become the
structured part of our brains by ordering information for easy retrieval.
Applications like [Keep](https://keep.google.com){target=_blank},
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md){target=_blank}, and
[Evernote](https://evernote.com){target=_blank} do just that. Each applications
uses a slightly different technique of tagging, structuring, and searching to
fit your particular need. So try them, to see what works for you.

So what exactly is a note? It is any piece of information, written in your own
words, that has potential value for you in the future. This can be an idea that
you thought of, the exact steps to perform a recurring task, or a detailed
concept that is difficult to remember. Anything that is not easily found online,
but that you still want to retrieve when you need it, without keeping it top of
mind.

With each note that add, your personal knowledge base becomes a google
alternative that is tailored to your way of thinking. So use it. Search your
notes, before consulting the internet. With time you will find the answer in
your notes more often.

To keep your notes useful, you have to review them periodically. This will
either give interesting ideas to (re)consider, or it will surface notes that are
less useful than initially thought. In the last case, do not be afraid to delete
the note. This housekeeping will keep your knowledge base up to date.

This can seem like a lot of extra work at first, and granted, it does take some
upfront effort for your collection of notes to have value. Once you start to
reap the benefits though, you will never go back.

## Next Steps

Here are the steps to get you on your way with notes.

1. Choose a note taking application.<br/>
    It doesn't really matter which one you choose as long as it is easily
    accessible and has both search and structuring functions to order your
    notes. (*No, Notepad and TextEdit are not an option.*)
1. Add notes with detailed steps on recurring tasks.<br/>
    This type of note will pay itself back quickly, because you won't have to
    remember the exact steps and because you will definitely need it in the
    future.
1. Search for the note, when you need to perform the task again.<br/>
    This will form the habit of searching your personal notes first and will
    immediately provide the positive feedback of quickly performing the steps in
    order with the help of your note.
1. Add notes with ideas you had, or interesting things you read about.<br/>
    Make sure you keep your notes short and specific. Just one concept per note
    with half a page of text at most. Add a reference to what you read.
1. Now search your notes first, before searching the internet.<br/>
1. Perform housekeeping.<br/>
    Go through your notes once a month to keep them up to date.
