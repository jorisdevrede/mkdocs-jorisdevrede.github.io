# Deep Work

We live in an "always on" world in which we are expected to promptly reply our
e-mail, actively respond to chat messages, and be available for phone calls.
This expectancy is even greater now that we are not always visibly in the office
anymore.

As knowledge workers, we need to concentrate to do our work. The more complex
the subject, the more we need to concentrate. In order to do that, we need to be
free from distractions, and that is exactly what getting more and more difficult
in todays workplace.
