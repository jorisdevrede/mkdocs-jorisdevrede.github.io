# Systems Thinking

In this section I look at subjects from 'systems' perspective, as defined by
Donella Meadows in her book
[Thinking in Systems: A Primer](https://www.google.com/search?q=thinking+in+systems).

Meadows defines a system as an interplay of stocks and flows. Stocks are the
elements of the system that you can see, count, or measure at any time. Flows
are the actions that change a stock over time. The stock can increase through
an inflow, or decrease through an outflow.

A basic example is the 'system' of a bathtub. The water in the bathtub is the
*stock*. The stock can be increased with the faucet that acts as an *inflow*,
and it can be decreased by drain that acts as an *outflow*.

You can make the system as complex or as simple as you need it to be, depending
on what it is you are analyzing. The bathtub can have an additional outflow,
for example, from the water that evaporates. Whether that extra complexity is
needed in your model of the system is up to you.
